This project is a simple webcam application built with C# and AForge.NET Framework. It allows users to:

Select a webcam from a dropdown list.
Start the webcam feed.
Capture and save images from the live webcam feed.
The application uses Windows Forms for the UI and AForge.NET for accessing and controlling the webcam.
